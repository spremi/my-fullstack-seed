# MyFullstackSeed

## INTRODUCTION

**MyFullstackSeed** is a simple 'Hello World' application.

Main intent of the application is to build a foundation
that can be used to seed other applications using
best practices available.

It is build with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/),
[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) and
[Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/)

Hoping that, soon, it would be in good shape to be wrapped in a generator.

### Why not leverage available generators?

I actively use [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generators esp. the
[angular-fullstack](https://github.com/angular-fullstack/generator-angular-fullstack).
But, haven't yet migrated to TypeScript. Still using v2.1.1 of the generator.
Auto-updating dependencies to newer versions doesn't work properly.

While fixing, the issues after auto-update of dependencies for another project,
decided to use the opportunity to understand the build mechanism better.

This is a learning project to build, first, an application infrastructure
from scratch, and then use it to create a generator.

It is quite possible that final result would be very similar to the
angular-fullstack scaffolding! But hope to make some value addition.
